Before running the tests, install the dependencies by running

```

After the packages are installed, install the Playwright browsers by running

```sh
npx playwright install
```

To run tests locally, you need to set the correct environment variables via a .env file. Ask the author to share one at [ierofeev.qa@gmail.com]()

```sh
ENV=sandbox npx playwright test
```

Tests are running in parallel mode by default

npm run allure-report
```

When running in CI, the Allure report is generated automatically and is available as a run artifact
